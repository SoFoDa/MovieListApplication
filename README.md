# Movie List Application

# Project Specification

### Functionality
The website will allow the user to create lists of movies they have seen and share their favourites with friends. You will start at a login screen where the user will either create a new account or give their account name and password to get access to the website. The homepage will consist of a feed that informs the user of the activity of the users they follow such as marking a movie as seen or adding a movie to their favourites. This feed will get updated through WebSockets. The user will be able to search for movies and add them to their “seen” list. They will also be able to search for users and follow them. Furthermore, there will be a view that gives statistics of the users movie habits such as favourite genres and the time spent watching movies (accumulative of the movies’ runtimes).
